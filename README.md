## Preparation
Make Sure You Installed:
* Latest [Java](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp)
* Java Development Kit ([JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows))

## Running
1. Run the Game by double-clicking `RunGame.bat`, don't touch the java files.
2. Chose your options:
    * `Player Name`: I'm still making the database part so that it could have a ranking. (So this feature is useless for now)
    * `Themes`: Choose your preferred themes, the default will be the Original theme of Flappy Bird.
    * `Difficulty`: Easy is easy, normal is normal, hard is smooth and for anyones who is familiar with the game already, and don't think about trying Impossible, you can't even pass the first pipe.
3. Click **PLAY** or **EXIT**.
